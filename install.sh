# AI Resume Tailor - Installation Script
# ==============================================================================
#
# This script automates the setup and launch of the AI Resume Tailor application
# using Docker. It will build the Docker image and run it as a container.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Docker must be installed and running on your system.
#
# What this script does:
#   1. Defines the application's name and port.
#   2. Checks if the Docker daemon is running.
#   3. Stops and removes any old container with the same name to prevent conflicts.
#   4. Builds a new Docker image for the application.
#   5. Starts a new container from the image.
#   6. Prints a success message with the URL to access the application.
#
# How to run:
#   1. Open your terminal.
#   2. Make the script executable by running: chmod +x install.sh
#   3. Run the script: ./install.sh
#
# ==============================================================================

# --- Configuration ---
# The name for your Docker container and image.
# You can change this if you want, but the default is fine.
APP_NAME="ai-resume-tailor"

# The port on your local machine that will be used to access the application.
# If this port is already in use, you can change it to another one (e.g., 8081).
LOCAL_PORT=8080

# The port the application runs on inside the Docker container (do not change this).
CONTAINER_PORT=80
